        <p class=blue-text>HTML and CSS form the foundation of website on the Internet is built upon. If you want to learn web development, HTML and CSS should be your first stepping stone. This talk will be interactive: attendees can follow along with the concepts introduced in the slides with the companion tutorial. By the end of the tutorial, participants will have a custom resume website.</p>
        <p class=blue-text>The HTML and CSS talk will do two things. The first is to show your how to write HTML and CSS code that will render a webpage just the way you want. The second is to give you a basic understanding of the structure of webpages, known as the DOM. Both are important if you would like to learn to make more interactive websites in the JavaScript, and Angular talks.</p>

        <p class=blue-text style="font-style: italic; margin-top: 5px">everything you can touch</p>
        <p class=blue-text style="margin-top: 50px">The frontend of a web application is everything that ends up running in the browser. It is written in three main languages, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.</p>
        <p class=blue-text>HTML and CSS store information about a page. HTML contains the content, which could include text, images, videos, and any number of other things. Complementary to this, CSS stores information about how to display the content stored by the HTML. This includes layout, color, fonts, and other information about how our site looks. With just HTML and CSS we can create beautiful, informational web pages that display the same information for everyone who loads them.</p>
        <p class=blue-text>On the other hand, JavaScript is a fully featured programming language. When run in a web browser, JavaScript can alter HTML and CSS on the fly, communicate with a web server, or perform computation all by itself. This opens the door to modern, interactive, experiences.</p>
        <p class=blue-text>HTML, CSS and JavaScript still form the core of web development, but companies have built tools on top of them to make it easier to build good-looking, high performance websites.</p>

        <div class=line></div>
        <p class=blue-text style="margin-top: 50px">Bring a computer with a web browser and text editor installed. We recommend <a class=pink_text href='https://www.google.com/chrome/'>Chrome</a> and <a class=pink_text href='http://www.sublimetext.com/'>Sublime Text</a>. <a class=pink_text href='http://brackets.io/'>Brackets</a> is also a great editor for web development, but might be a bit overwhelming if this is your first experience writing a lot of code.If youâ€™re more comfortable with another editor, feel free to use it.</p>

        <div class=line></div>
        <p class=blue-text style="margin-top: 50px">To follow along, go to the <a class=pink_text href='https://scottylabs.org/wdw-htmlcss/'>demo website</a>. As we introduce new topics during the talk, the companion website will show you examples of source code and its output to illustrate concepts.</p>
        <p class=blue-text>We also created a list of suggested websites and other resources for further exploration once you are finished with the talk.</p>
